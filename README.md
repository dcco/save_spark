
Source code for "Journey to Save Spark".

This is a game made by me and my friend Edshard for Ludwig Jam 2023.

The source code for the game is written in "Oth Lite" a toy language that is also made by me. Oth Lite is not really a serious language, as it compiles text files into Javascript, and essentially just serves as a very complicated wrapper for WebGL and other functionality. Nevertheless, the full source code for the Oth Lite compiler/runtime is provided in the oth_lite/src directory, and is provided as open source (although honestly it's lacking in so many features you would want in a real language).

The actual source code is in the oth_lite/rom directory in `oth` files. toc.json provides the compilation order of files, settings.json configures the compiler.
